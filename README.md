Title: "Tap the Target"

Objective: The objective of the game is to tap the moving target as many times as possible within a given time limit.

Gameplay:

The game starts with a target positioned at a random location on the screen.
The target moves around the screen at a constant speed, changing direction whenever it hits the screen boundaries.
The player earns points by tapping the target.
Each time the player taps the target, it disappears and reappears at a new random location on the screen.
The game ends after a specified time limit (e.g., 30 seconds).
The player's final score is displayed at the end of the game.
Features to consider adding:

Display a timer countdown during gameplay.
Add sound effects or visual effects when the target is tapped.
Implement a high score system to track and display the player's best scores.
Include different levels of difficulty, such as increasing the target speed or reducing its size over time.
Remember to handle touch events and collision detection to detect when the player taps the target. You can use the GestureDetector widget for handling taps, and track the target's position using a timer or animation controller.
